I am a statistician and associate professor in the [School of Education](https://education.wisc.edu/) at the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/), where I teach in the [Educational Psychology Department](https://edpsych.education.wisc.edu/) and the [graduate program in Quantitative Methods](https://edpsych.education.wisc.edu/academics/quantitative-methods/). My research involves developing statistical methods for problems in education, psychology, and other areas of social science research, with a focus on methods related to research synthesis and meta-analysis.
