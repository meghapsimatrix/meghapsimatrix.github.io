***Lessons Learned from a Participatory Evidence Synthesis***

- Speaker: [Sarah Peko-Spicer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarah-peko-spicer-640a4436/), American Institutes for Research

- Description: Education policy has long been plagued by a knowledge-to-action gap. Researchers have minimized this gap by engaging individuals who are directly affected by policy in primary research studies using participatory research methods (PRM). PRM emphasize academic researchers working alongside youth, practitioners, and community members to co-construct knowledge and effect change through localized, community-driven implementation. Many studies that use PRM are qualitative in nature, leaving many researchers wondering about the extent to which PRM can be used to support quantitative inquiries, including quantitative syntheses. In this talk, the authors will discuss a 10-session training, developed to facilitate a participatory evidence synthesis on social and emotional learning programs and strategies.
