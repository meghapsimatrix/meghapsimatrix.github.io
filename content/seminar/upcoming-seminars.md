***Using GPT API Models as Second Screeners of Titles and Abstracts in High-Quality Systematic Reviews***

- Speaker: [Dr. Mikkel Vembye](https://www.vive.dk/en/staff/mikkel-helding-vembye-568r9kvr/), Danish Center for Social Science Research

- Description: Independent human double screening of titles and abstracts is a critical step to ensure the quality of systematic reviews and meta-analyses. However, double screening is a resource-demanding procedure that slows down the review process. In this presentation, I will demonstrate how reviewers reliably can implement OpenAIâ€™s GPT models as second screeners of title and abstracts to mitigate this resource demand. I will provide a practical demonstration of how to conduct title and abstract screening with GPT API models through the newly developed R package AIscreenR and highlight how the approach differs from simply using the ChatGPT interface. I will discuss implementation requirements for ensuring performance that is at least on par with typical human screening. To facilitate this, I will introduce a new screening benchmark scheme that is based on common human screening performance in 22 large-scale systematic reviews. As the initial proof of concept, I will present results of using GPT API screening in three large classification experiments. I will conclude by discussing limitations and future directions for this screening method and how it can be combined with traditional (semi-)automated screening tools.
