***ESHackathon: Unlocking Evidence Synthesis Through Innovation***

- Speaker: [Matthew Grainger](https://drmattg.github.io/Uncertain_Ecologist/), Researcher, Norwegian Institute for Nature Research

- Description: Founded in 2017 by Martin Westgate and Neal Haddaway, the Evidence Synthesis Hackathon ([ESHackathon](https://www.eshackathon.org/)) aims to support the development, testing and promotion of new software and workflows; build networks and capacity among researchers, practitioners and developers; and advocate for open synthesis. The organization's goal is to create workflows that are open, reproducible, based on the best available technology and methods, and supported by the community. ESHackathon is not just for coders but is a community of practice where everyone can make a contribution and which is welcoming to a diversity of skills and career-stages. In this talk, Dr. Matt Grainger will highlight some of ESHackathon's most popular tools, including [citationchaser](https://www.eshackathon.org/software/citationchaser.html), [EviAtlas](https://www.eshackathon.org/software/eviatlas.html), and [Prisma2020](https://www.eshackathon.org/software/PRISMA2020.html). He will also showcase some of the tools that are currently in development and discuss ideas for new tools.
