We are currently planning seminars for Fall 2024 and Spring 2025. Please feel free to reach out with suggestions, including self-nominations, to [James Pustejovsky](mailto:pustejovsky@wisc.edu). Nominations will be considered if they fall within the scope of the seminar series. Speakers need not be members of AERA. We welcome scholars from outside of North America.
