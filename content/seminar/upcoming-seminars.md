***Adapting Methods for Correcting Selective Reporting Bias in Meta-Analysis of Dependent Effect Sizes***

- Speaker: [Dr. Man Chen](https://education.utexas.edu/faculty/man_chen/), University of Texas at Austin

- Description: Various methods have been proposed to adjust for selective reporting bias in average effect size estimates under the assumption that each study produces one effect size. However, there remains a need to investigate the selection bias adjustment methods in meta-analysis with multiple, dependent effect sizes. In this presentation, I will demonstrate novel adaptations of several adjustment methods based on a multivariate working model and weighting scheme that correct for selective reporting bias while handling dependencies among effect sizes. I will present the performance of existing adjustment methods and the novel adaptations based on an extensive Monte Carlo simulation study. I will conclude with a discussion of limitations, future directions, and suggestions for correcting selection bias in the context of dependent effect sizes. The presentation will cover research described in a pre-print available at https://doi.org/10.31222/osf.io/jq52s.
