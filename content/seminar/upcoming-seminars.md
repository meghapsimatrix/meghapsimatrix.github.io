***Advances in Methods for Overviews of Reviews***

-   Speaker: [Carole Lunny](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7825-6765), Knowledge Translation program at the University of Toronto and Cochrane Hypertension Review Group at the University of British Columbia

-   Description: Since 2018, significant methodological advances in how to conduct overviews of reviews have been published. This presentation briefly orients participants to some of the guidance, tools and methods recently published on overviews of reviews. I will present the methods work by our team on: (i) the prevalence of overviews, journal impact factors and number of citations, (ii) a taxonomy for categorising overviews with similar eligibility criteria, (iii) how to handle overlap in primary study data across systematic reviews on the same topic, (iv) replication of the Jadad algorithm to assess discordance, (v) survey of decision makers to determine how they compare and choose amongst competing systematic review on the same topic, and (vi) development of the WISEST AI tool to automatically quality assess and compare the PICO, methods and results across systematic reviews on the same topic.
