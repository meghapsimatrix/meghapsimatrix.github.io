***Launching a Living Systematic Review of SEL in a Politically Charged Climate: From Evidence Synthesis to Practical Significance***

- Speaker: [Dr. Christina Cipriano](https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/christina-cipriano/), Yale School of Medicine

- Description: Improving student academic, social, emotional, and behavioral outcomes in school through efficacious social and emotional learning programs is simultaneously an area of national urgency and political criticism. Towards this end, a first of its kind living systematic review was launched to monitor the evolving inputs and outcomes of social and emotional learning programs in a dynamic educational landscape. In this session, Dr. Cipriano will discuss (1) what is a living systematic review and how it differs from a traditional systematic review and meta-analysis, (2) why this methodology holds utility for social and emotional learning evidence, and (3) critical challenges as opportunities to advance access and use of social and emotional learning evidence in a political charged climate.
