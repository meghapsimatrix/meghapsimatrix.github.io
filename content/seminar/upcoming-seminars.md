***Investigating Patterns of Fadeout using MERF, the Meta-Analysis of Educational RCTs with Follow-up***

- Speaker: [Emma Hart](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Emma-Hart-30), Doctoral Candidate, Teachers College, Columbia University

- Description: Researchers and policymakers aspire for educational interventions to change children’s long-run developmental trajectories. Developmental theory has informed this expectation; boosts to child skills should initiate developmental cascades consistent with long-run intervention effects. Increasing evidence suggests that while interventions often generate impacts on child skills at post-test, these effects commonly fade in the years following the intervention’s end. In this talk, I will present new work that uses meta-analysis to investigate the breadth of fadeout by skill type and intervention characteristics. I will discuss using meta-analysis to test developmental theory and inform policy decision-making.
