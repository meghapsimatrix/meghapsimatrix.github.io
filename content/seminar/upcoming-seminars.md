***MetaReviewer: A Free, Collaborative, Browser-Based Tool for Conducting Data Extraction***

- Speaker: [Joshua Polanin](https://www.air.org/experts/person/joshua-r-polanin), American Institutes for Research 

- Description: Collecting evidence synthesis data from even a few studies presents numerous logistical and organizational challenges. Reviewers with the expertise or resources turn to bespoke database software or costly meta-analysis programs. In the absence of resources or expertise, many reviewers turn to a spreadsheet, which can lead to inaccurate or unreliable data collection. With this in mind, we created a program for the collection of evidence synthesis information called MetaReviewer. Dr. Polanin will demonstrate some of its capabilities and functionalities and discuss potential future upgrades. Although the Beta testing period is over and we currently are not accepting new users, you can also check out the beta version here: https://www.metareviewer.org/ We expect to release an updated version in the fall of 2023.
