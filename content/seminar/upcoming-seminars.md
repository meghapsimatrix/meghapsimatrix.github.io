***Designing for Epistemic Uncertainty in Research Synthesis***

- Speaker: [Alex Kale](https://cs.uchicago.edu/people/alex-kale/), University of Chicago, Department of Computer Science

- Description: Summarizing what can be learned from bodies of scientific literature requires difficult judgments about which study results can be meaningfully compared, and whether it makes sense to aggregate evidence in a meta-analysis. Numerous tools for assessing quality of evidence offer guidance on identifying sources of epistemic uncertainty, such as common threats to internal or external validity of study results. However, existing software for systematic review and meta-analysis does little to emphasize how epistemic uncertainty should inform analytic choices for synthesizing findings. I present MetaExplorer, a prototype web application designed to provide a guided process for reasoning about epistemic uncertainty in meta-analysis. I also summarize findings from interviews with research synthesis methodologists and practitioners in biomedical science, education, computer science, and statistics. This work highlights the cognitive pitfalls, technical hurdles, and inconsistent standards across research communities that pose challenges to addressing epistemic uncertainty in research synthesis. I reflect on opportunities for future software development and invite the audience to join me in discussion.
