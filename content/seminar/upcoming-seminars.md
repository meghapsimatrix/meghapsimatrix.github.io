***Meta-Analytic QuantCrit: Exploring the Possibilities***

- Speaker: [Jamaal Young](https://scholars.library.tamu.edu/vivo/display/nc1659a42/Persons/View%20All), Texas A&M University 

- Description: Meta-analyses of critical issues are worthwhile in the field of education because they provide evidence that informs strategies and policies to support statistically stigmatized and stereotyped students (4S). QuantCrit can guide the design, implementation, and interpretation of meta-analyses of critical issues as a research paradigm to support equitable learning outcomes. Nevertheless, I am unaware of any approaches to meta-analytic QuantCrit. Thus, the goal of this session is to set the stage for exploring how QuantCrit could be applied to meta-analytic thinking and research. To accomplish this goal, I will provide an overview of QuantCrit and its five tenets: 1) the centrality of racism; 2) numbers are not neutral; 3) categories are neither ‘natural’ nor given, and models that treat categories as causal often conceal the operation of power and ideology; 4) voice and insight (data cannot speak for itself); and 5) a social justice/equity orientation (Gillborn et al., 2018). I will conclude by providing specific examples of each tenet within the context of meta-analytic thinking and practice.

***Lessons Learned from a Participatory Evidence Synthesis***

- Speaker: [Sarah Peko-Spicer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarah-peko-spicer-640a4436/), American Institutes for Research

- Description: Education policy has long been plagued by a knowledge-to-action gap. Researchers have minimized this gap by engaging individuals who are directly affected by policy in primary research studies using participatory research methods (PRM). PRM emphasize academic researchers working alongside youth, practitioners, and community members to co-construct knowledge and effect change through localized, community-driven implementation. Many studies that use PRM are qualitative in nature, leaving many researchers wondering about the extent to which PRM can be used to support quantitative inquiries, including quantitative syntheses. In this talk, the authors will discuss a 10-session training, developed to facilitate a participatory evidence synthesis on social and emotional learning programs and strategies.
