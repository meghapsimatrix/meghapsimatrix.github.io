## December 13, 2024, 11 am CST

***Friday the 13th & Single Case Experimental Designs: Allegedly Unlucky Encounters for Meta-Analysts***

- Speakers: [Dr. John Ferron](https://www.usf.edu/education/faculty/faculty-profiles/john-ferron.aspx), University of South Florida,
and [Dr. Megan Kirby](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-megan-kirby-54b2a211/), Language Dynamics Group

- Description: With increased use of single-case experimental designs to study intervention effects, there is a greater need to include single-case experimental design studies in meta-analyses. In this session, we will discuss alternative methods for estimating effects from single-case studies, illustrate the estimation of these effects from freely available software apps, and provide guidance about choosing among the effect size options.
