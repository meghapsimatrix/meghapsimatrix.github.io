***Synthesizing Individual Participant Data Obtained From Complex Sampling Surveys: A Two-Stage IPD Meta-Analysis Approach***

-   Speaker: [Diego Campos](https://diegocampos.co/), University of Oslo

-   Description: The growing availability of individual participant data (IPD) shared by researchers and larger institutions provides new opportunities for meta-analyses. However, some of the readily accessible data sets are based on complex sampling designsâ€”that is, designs that typically involve multi-stage sampling, clustering, and stratification. Accounting for different sample procedures, stages, clusters, and weights across datasets and dealing with the hierarchical structure of the primary and meta-analytic data are some of the methodological challenges in synthesizing individual participant data from complex sampling studies. Thus, the analysis and synthesis of complex survey data need to consider the sample design features of the primary studies and the dependencies among effect sizes during the meta-analysis. We propose a two-stage individual participant data meta-analysis approach to address these challenges. This talk will illustrate this approach and present hands-on steps for synthesizing IPD from complex sampling surveys.
