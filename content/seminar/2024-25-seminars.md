***Using GPT API Models as Second Screeners of Titles and Abstracts in High-Quality Systematic Reviews***

- Speaker: [Dr. Mikkel Vembye](https://www.vive.dk/en/staff/mikkel-helding-vembye-568r9kvr/), Danish Center for Social Science Research

- Description: Independent human double screening of titles and abstracts is a critical step to ensure the quality of systematic reviews and meta-analyses. However, double screening is a resource-demanding procedure that slows down the review process. In this presentation, I will demonstrate how reviewers reliably can implement OpenAIâ€™s GPT models as second screeners of title and abstracts to mitigate this resource demand. I will provide a practical demonstration of how to conduct title and abstract screening with GPT API models through the newly developed R package AIscreenR and highlight how the approach differs from simply using the ChatGPT interface. I will discuss implementation requirements for ensuring performance that is at least on par with typical human screening. To facilitate this, I will introduce a new screening benchmark scheme that is based on common human screening performance in 22 large-scale systematic reviews. As the initial proof of concept, I will present results of using GPT API screening in three large classification experiments. I will conclude by discussing limitations and future directions for this screening method and how it can be combined with traditional (semi-)automated screening tools.

***Fitting Flexible Meta-Analytic Models with Structural Equation Modeling***

- Speaker: [Dr. Mike Cheung](https://mikewlcheung.github.io/), National University of Singapore

- Description: Understanding the differences between various meta-analytic models, such as the fixed-effect, random-effects, and multiplicative error models, can be challenging for researchers. This presentation explains these models using a graphical representation within a structural equation modeling (SEM) framework. Users specify meta-analytic models using lavaan syntax. The metaSEM package in R can convert these models to graphical models, model-implied mean and variance, and fit models using the Full Information Maximum Likelihood (FIML) estimation method. Complex meta-analytic models, such as multivariate meta-analysis and mediation models, can also be fitted. Users without strong statistical and programming backgrounds can still develop and implement novel meta-analytic models that are not available in standard meta-analysis software.
