The AERA SIG on Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis is proud to present a regular, online seminar series on the methodology of systematic reviews, meta-analysis, and evidence synthesis for education research and the broader social sciences. Live seminars are scheduled for ***Third Fridays*** of the month, from 9-10 a.m. Pacific/10-11 a.m. Mountain/11 a.m.-12 noon Central/12-1 p.m. Eastern/16:00-17:00 UTC. The seminars are open to all (you need not be a SIG or AERA member) but require registering. Most talks will be recorded and made available for later viewing.

***Modeling Statistical Artefacts in Meta-Analysis***

-   Speaker: [Brenton Wiernik](https://wiernik.org/), University of South Florida

-   Description: Most published meta-analyses address only artefactual variance due to sampling error and ignore the role of other statistical and psychometric artefacts, such as measurement error (due to factors including unreliability of measurements, group misclassification, and variable treatment strength) and selection effects (including range restriction/enhancement and collider biases). These artefacts can have severe biasing effects on the results of individual studies and meta-analyses. Failing to account for these artefacts can lead to inaccurate conclusions about the mean effect size and between-studies effect-size heterogeneity, and can influence the results of meta-regression, publication bias, and sensitivity analyses. In this talk, I will provide a brief introduction to the biasing effects of measurement error and selection effects and their relevance to a variety of research designs, including connecting to the broader literatures on measurement modeling and causal inference in statistical analysis. I will describe how to estimate the effects of several artefacts in different research designs and correct for their impacts in meta-analyses. This talk is based in part a paper available from <https://psyarxiv.com/9mpbn/>. Example code implementing methods in R will be provided. The speaker will present for 30-45 minutes, followed by a Q&A and discussion period.

***One-stage Meta-Analytic Structural Equation Modeling***

-   Speaker: [Suzanne Jak](http://www.suzannejak.nl/), University of Amsterdam

-   Description: Meta-analytic structural equation modeling (MASEM) refers to fitting structural equation models (such as path models or factor models) to meta-analytic data. The meta-analytic data generally consists of correlations across the variables in the path or factor model, obtained from multiple primary studies. In this talk, I will contrast univariate MASEM to multivariate MASEM. Univariate MASEM refers to performing multiple univariate meta-analyses in order to obtain a synthesized correlation matrix as input in a SEM program. Multivariate MASEM in contrast involves using multivariate meta-analysis to synthesize correlation matrices across studies (e.g., GLS, TSSEM, one-stage MASEM). I will show that although univariate MASEM is the default MASEM method in for example organizational psychology, results obtained from univariate MASEM cannot be trusted. The reason that univariate MASEM is still often used, may be that fitting MASEMs may be challenging for researchers that are not accustomed to working with R software and packages. Therefore, we developed webMASEM; a web application for MASEM. This app implements the one-stage MASEM approach, and allows users to apply multivariate MASEM in a user-friendly way.

***Implications of Open Science for Research Syntheses in Education***

-   Speaker: [Erika Patall](https://rossier.usc.edu/faculty/erika-patall/), University of Southern California

-   Description: Extensive debate about common, yet questionable research practices that lead to biased findings within social and health sciences has emerged over the last decade. Similar challenges likely apply to education research, though the field has been slow to address them. In this talk, I  discuss current research norms, strategic solutions proposed under the broad rubric of “Open Science”, and the implications of both for the way research syntheses in education are conducted and the quality of the information they produce. Strategies such as preregistration, transparent reporting, open materials and data, and registered reports stand to address significant threats to the validity of research syntheses. These include challenges associated with publication, dissemination, and selective reporting biases, comprehensive information retrieval, and opportunities to execute unique analytic approaches. Parallel solutions that address biases in the decision making and practices of researchers conducting and evaluating research syntheses will also be discussed, along with the challenges and tips associated with their implementation.
