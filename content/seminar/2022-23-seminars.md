***Usage of Individual Patient Data Meta-Analysis to Synthesize Single-Case Research Data***

-   Speaker: [Mariola Moeyaert](https://www.albany.edu/education/faculty/mariola-moeyaert), SUNY Albany

-   Description: We have entered an era in which scientific knowledge and evidence increasingly informs research practice and policy. As the use of personalized trials increases, there is a remarkable and growing interest in the quantitative synthesis of single-case design (SCD) data. One technique that is developed and can be applied for this purpose is individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis (also called raw SCD data meta-analysis). The IPD approach provides detailed information about intervention effectiveness and intervention heterogeneity. IPD is a flexible modeling approach, allowing for a variety of modeling options such as modeling moderators to explain intervention heterogeneity. During the seminar, the IPD meta-analytic technique (with the inclusion of moderators) will be introduced and demonstrated, and statistical properties of the model parameters will be discussed.
