***Your New Best Friend, Heterogeneity: Diverse Evidence Types and Diverse Methods to Address Explanatory Questions in Systematic Reviews***

- Speaker: [G.J. Melendez-Torres](https://medicine.exeter.ac.uk/people/profile/index.php?web_id=GJ_Melendez-Torres), University of Exeter 

- Description: Heterogeneity is, to many meta-analysts, an irritation or an afterthought: a nuisance parameter, an opportunity for misinterpretation, or (for the workshy) an excuse to avoid meta-analysis completely.  But viewed another way, heterogeneity provides an essential basis for meta-analyses that go beyond inferential tests and summative answers to explanatory insights.  In this discussion, I consider deductive, abductive and inductive methods that move past ‘exploring’ heterogeneity to capitalising on heterogeneity as an opportunity to deliver better, more useful findings for policy and practice impact, in bodies of evidence both large and small.

***Comprehensive and Transparently Reported Search Strategies***

-   Speaker: [Amy Riegelman](https://www.lib.umn.edu/about/staff/amy-riegelman), University of Minnesota 

-   Description: By definition, systematic reviews and meta-analyses are supposed to have exhaustive and comprehensive literature searches. Additionally, the strategies used to identify relevant literature need to be transparently reported in order to facilitate reproducibility. While some research topics are well indexed and therefore readily discoverable, literature on others research topics is dispersed across many databases and search engines, which poses challenges for systematic searching. Furthermore, grey literature is often sought for reviews, but grey sources can be very challenging to identify. This talk will describe guidelines and best practices for targeting the relevant literature while balancing precision and recall. This seminar will also include tips and tricks for conducting comprehensive searches while adhering to guidelines (e.g., PRISMA) to help ensure reproducibility of search methods.

***Synthesizing Individual Participant Data Obtained From Complex Sampling Surveys: A Two-Stage IPD Meta-Analysis Approach***

-   Speaker: [Diego Campos](https://diegocampos.co/), University of Oslo

-   Description: The growing availability of individual participant data (IPD) shared by researchers and larger institutions provides new opportunities for meta-analyses. However, some of the readily accessible data sets are based on complex sampling designs—that is, designs that typically involve multi-stage sampling, clustering, and stratification. Accounting for different sample procedures, stages, clusters, and weights across datasets and dealing with the hierarchical structure of the primary and meta-analytic data are some of the methodological challenges in synthesizing individual participant data from complex sampling studies. Thus, the analysis and synthesis of complex survey data need to consider the sample design features of the primary studies and the dependencies among effect sizes during the meta-analysis. We propose a two-stage individual participant data meta-analysis approach to address these challenges. This talk will illustrate this approach and present hands-on steps for synthesizing IPD from complex sampling surveys.

**Advances in Methods for Overviews of Reviews**

-   Speaker: [Carole Lunny](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7825-6765), Knowledge Translation program at the University of Toronto and Cochrane Hypertension Review Group at the University of British Columbia

-   Description: Since 2018, significant methodological advances in how to conduct overviews of reviews have been published. This presentation briefly orients participants to some of the guidance, tools and methods recently published on overviews of reviews. I will present the methods work by our team on: (i) the prevalence of overviews, journal impact factors and number of citations, (ii) a taxonomy for categorising overviews with similar eligibility criteria, (iii) how to handle overlap in primary study data across systematic reviews on the same topic, (iv) replication of the Jadad algorithm to assess discordance, (v) survey of decision makers to determine how they compare and choose amongst competing systematic review on the same topic, and (vi) development of the WISEST AI tool to automatically quality assess and compare the PICO, methods and results across systematic reviews on the same topic.

***Usage of Individual Patient Data Meta-Analysis to Synthesize Single-Case Research Data***

-   Speaker: [Mariola Moeyaert](https://www.albany.edu/education/faculty/mariola-moeyaert), SUNY Albany

-   Description: We have entered an era in which scientific knowledge and evidence increasingly informs research practice and policy. As the use of personalized trials increases, there is a remarkable and growing interest in the quantitative synthesis of single-case design (SCD) data. One technique that is developed and can be applied for this purpose is individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis (also called raw SCD data meta-analysis). The IPD approach provides detailed information about intervention effectiveness and intervention heterogeneity. IPD is a flexible modeling approach, allowing for a variety of modeling options such as modeling moderators to explain intervention heterogeneity. During the seminar, the IPD meta-analytic technique (with the inclusion of moderators) will be introduced and demonstrated, and statistical properties of the model parameters will be discussed.
