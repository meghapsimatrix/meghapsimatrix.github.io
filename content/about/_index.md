The Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis SIG (SIG 173) is centered around supporting and showcasing both applied and methodological research on systematic reviews and meta-analysis.

The SRMA SIG has three main **purposes**:

1.  To promote the use of systematic review and meta-analysis to answer critical educational-focused questions.
2.  To foster the development of systematic review and meta-analysis methods specific to applied research in education.
3.  To educate researchers and practitioners on the best practices of meta-analysis.

In order to meet those purposes, the SRMA SIG has three main **goals**:

1.  To produce high-quality systematic reviews and meta-analyses on educational topics.
2.  To develop new methods and improve old methods of quantitative synthesis dedicated for the use in education and related fields.
3.  To increase the knowledge of researchers and practitioners who utilize systematic reviews or meta-analysis.

**SRMA SIG Membership** is open to any and all AERA members. For the first year, the cost to join is only \$5 for both non-students and students.
