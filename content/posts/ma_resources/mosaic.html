<p>The American Institutes for Research® (AIR®) recently launched the
<a href="http://mosaic.air.org/">Methods of Synthesis and Integration
Center (MOSAIC)</a>. The center supports projects
that synthesize evidence across multiple studies to inform stakeholders
and create evidence-based solutions in education, health, international
development, social welfare, and the workforce. At MOSAIC, leading
experts in evidence synthesis methodology work to develop
state-of-the-art synthesis tools. AIR’s <a href="https://www.air.org/experts/person/martyna-citkowicz">Martyna
Citkowicz</a>, <a href="https://www.air.org/experts/person/laura-michaelson">Laura

Polanin</a>, and <a href="https://www.air.org/experts/person/ryan-williams">Ryan
Williams</a> lead the
center.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, MOSAIC researchers, sponsored by the Institute of
Education Sciences, completed the largest systematic review and
meta-analysis of mathematics intervention effects to date. AIR shared
the results of the project, including the underlying data, through an
<a href="https://www.air.org/centers/mosaic/mosaic-db" title="interactive web tool">interactive web
tool</a>
that enables users to “build their own” meta-analysis. The tool
summarizes results from more than 200 mathematics intervention studies
from the last 25 years and presents the results through a host of
analytics and visuals. </p>
