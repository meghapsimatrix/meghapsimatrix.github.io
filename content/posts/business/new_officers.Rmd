I look forward to working with our new officers. I would also like to offer special thanks to our [current officers](/leadership/) and to everyone who stepped forward to run for office this year. We all appreciate your commitment to the SIG and willingness to serve as an officer, and I hope that you will remain involved with our work in the future.
