<p><strong>Tell us a bit about yourself.</strong></p>
<p>My name is Diego G. Campos. I am a Ph.D. Candidate at the Centre for
Educational Measurement at the University of Oslo (CEMO). I am working
with Prof. Ronny Scherer and Prof. Mike Cheung to develop, use, and
evaluate meta-analytic approaches to synthesize individual participant
data from complex survey studies. We have outstanding educational data
from large-scale assessments collected at the national and international
levels. However, we have not successfully integrated those data sources
in systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Individual participant data
meta-analysis can provide us with tools to test relationships and
describe distributions in these large, high-quality samples. Results
from that enterprise can inform educational practices and develop
educational policies. In my Ph.D. project, I hope to build and offer
clear guidelines to use that data in systematic reviews and
meta-analyses.</p>
<p><strong>How did you get into systematic review and/or meta-analysis
research?</strong></p>
<p>While I was doing my master’s, there was a lot of fuzz around the
replication crisis. It was challenging to decide between contradictory
evidence and identify the best evidence-based practices in teaching and
learning. The open science movement changed my mind about science. I
learned about the importance of the replicability, robustness, and
generalizability of empirical findings. Then, in conversation with my
Ph.D. supervisor, he pointed out the field of systematic reviews and
meta-analyses. After doing some research, I realized that meta-analyses
are a great tool to help create a cumulative body of knowledge in the
social sciences. So here I am, trying to contribute to that task.</p>
<p><strong>What work do you do now that is related to systematic review and/or
meta-analysis?</strong></p>
<p>I am working on synthesizing information on digital divides. The
COVID-19 accelerated the transformation of education towards digital
education, so it is crucial to identify populations that can be harmed
the most for lack of access to technology. Hopefully, the evidence will
serve as a guide for developing targeted solutions to specific
populations. I am also looking into more methodological research
questions. For example, I am testing the robustness of meta-analytic
structural equational models (MASEM). I hope we can inform how robust
these methodologies are to variations in some assumptions.</p>
<p><strong>What do you love about systematic review and/or meta-analysis?</strong></p>
<p>I love that it provides a framework to test a theoretical hypothesis’s
robustness. It is difficult to decide between contradictory evidence and
understand the sources of differences. However, systematic reviews and
meta-analyses enable researchers to compile multiple pieces of evidence,
explore possible sources of the differences and build a take-home
message for other researchers, practitioners, and policy-makers—all of
this while striving for systematicity, reproducibility, and openness.</p>
<p><strong>What advice do you have for graduate students and early career
researchers about working in systematic review and meta-analysis
research?</strong></p>
<p>It is crucial to get yourself familiar with the software and statistical
packages that can support you with searching, screening, coding, and
analyzing the data. A few handy tools, for example, are the
<a href="https://elizagrames.github.io/litsearchr/"><code>litsearchr</code></a> R package that
can help you to develop your search strategy. The reference manager
<a href="https://www.zotero.org/">Zotero</a> can support you in saving and storing
your searches. <a href="https://www.covidence.org/">Covidence</a>, Google Survey,
or Excel can help you in the process of screening and coding your
literature. Finally, the
<a href="https://wviechtb.github.io/metafor/reference/metafor-package.html"><code>metafor</code></a>,
<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/metaSEM/index.html"><code>metaSEM</code></a>,
<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/robumeta/index.html"><code>robumeta</code></a>,
and <a href="https://jepusto.github.io/clubSandwich/"><code>clubSandwich</code></a> R packages
can help you analyze your data.</p>
<p>If you want to know about new software and statistical packages, the
<a href="https://www.eshackathon.org/">Evidence Synthesis Hackaton</a> is a great
place to do that. Also, do not forget to get yourself a pair of
sweatpants and a comfy couch; you will spend quite some time there while
doing a systematic review.</p>
