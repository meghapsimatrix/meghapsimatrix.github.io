**Tell us a bit about yourself.**

My name is Jacqueline (Jaki) Yi. I am a Ph.D. candidate studying
Clinical-Community Psychology at the University of Illinois at Urbana
Champaign. I have a Bachelor's in Science in Applied Psychology from New
York University. In my program of research, I use various inquiry
methods (e.g., meta-analysis, structural equation modeling, grounded
theory qualitative methods, mixed methods) to challenge systemic
inequality, foster activism, and improve the wellbeing of individuals
and broader society. My first line of research focuses on Asian American
students and aims to address gaps in the literature on their racial
attitudes and engagement in social change. My second line of research
more broadly examines diversity and social justice attitudes and
interventions in higher education. I also engage in research that helps
to improve my campus context, such as evaluating diversity trainings and
student affairs programming. In the future, I hope to use my research
skills to continue to contribute to the academic literature and my local
contexts by exploring the mental health implications of racial
ideologies and developing and evaluating diversity-related
interventions.

**How did you get into systematic review and/or meta-analysis
research?**

Through coursework in both my undergraduate and graduate studies, I
learned literature searching and writing skills that were invaluable for
my future research pursuits. An assignment for one of my first-year
graduate courses was a systematic review of the literature, where we
learned to comprehensively search online databases and identify all
relevant published and unpublished research on a topic of our choice.
Students were encouraged to use these projects to conduct meta-analyses
in the future. In conversation and collaboration with my research
mentors, I worked on identifying a question that represents a gap in the
literature and began my meta-analysis journey.

**What work do you do now that is related to systematic review and/or
meta-analysis?**

My collaborators (Helen A. Neville, Nathan R. Todd, and Yara Mekawi) and
I recently published a meta-analysis titled, [Ignoring Race and Denying
Racism: A Meta-Analysis of the Associations Between Colorblind Racial
Ideology, Anti-Blackness, and Other Variables Antithetical to Racial
Justice](https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/cou-cou0000618.pdf).
Our team analyzed 375 effects drawn from 83 studies on racism with more
than 25,000 individuals. We found that people who deny the existence of
structural racism are more likely to exhibit anti-Black prejudice and
less likely to be racially empathetic and open to diversity. However,
there were no similar findings for those who claim that they ignore
racial group differences, which was instead associated with greater
openness for diversity. Our meta-analytic results emphasize that denying
structural racism and ignoring race are two different types of
colorblind racial ideology, and researchers and educators need to
delineate between them because they appear to have different outcomes.
Our research was published online in the Journal of Counseling
Psychology and was highlighted in [a press release by the American
Psychological
Association](https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2022/05/denial-structural-racism-antiblack-prejudice).

**What do you love about systematic review and/or meta-analysis?**

I love that meta-analyses can help to clarify previous understandings of
phenomena in the field. For example, the literature base on colorblind
racial ideology is huge, and there are disparate findings that make it
difficult to draw conclusions about its associations with anti-Blackness
and systemic racism. Meta-analysis is a powerful research tool for
systematically exploring such tensions in the literature and providing
insights for future scholarship and practice.

**What advice do you have for graduate students and early career
researchers about working in systematic review and meta-analysis
research?**

If you are interested in conducting a meta analysis, go for it! Indeed,
it is a large undertaking and requires a lot of time, persistence, and
attention to detail. Yet, it was one of the most rewarding research
endeavors of my graduate career, and I owe it to my incredible team of
collaborators. My main advice for those interested in pursuing a
meta-analytic project would be to build supportive relationships with
other scholars and work as a team.
