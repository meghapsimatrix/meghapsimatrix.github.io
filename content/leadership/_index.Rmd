I am a statistician and associate professor in the [School of Education](https://education.wisc.edu/) at the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/), where I teach in the [Educational Psychology Department](https://edpsych.education.wisc.edu/) and the [graduate program in Quantitative Methods](https://edpsych.education.wisc.edu/academics/quantitative-methods/). My research involves developing statistical methods for problems in education, psychology, and other areas of social science research, with a focus on methods related to research synthesis and meta-analysis.

## **Program Co-Chairs**

I am an educational psychologist and an associate professor in the College of Education at Texas State University. I apply research synthesis methods to study the role of motivation and self-regulation in postsecondary student learning. I have served on the editorial team of Campbell Systematic Reviews and on the editorial board of Review of Educational Research, Educational Psychology Review, and Journal of Educational Psychology, among others. My research syntheses have also been published in the previously mentioned journals as well as Educational Research Review, Journal of Experimental Education, and Educational Policy. I am the PI of an NSF-funded grant, [Psychosocial Interventions to Improve Postsecondary Student Mathematics Attainment: A Meta-Analysis Exploring What Works and for Whom](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2300030).

I am a clinical assistant professor of special education at the University of Iowa. My research focuses on the literacy development of students with low-incidence disabilities, specifically the reading and writing skills of students with intellectual and developmental disabilities. I have studied the effects of literacy interventions for this population across the lifespan. My work also concerns literacy skills more broadly, including examining the association between working memory and writing outcomes for students with and without disabilities. I am the Methods Editor for the Disability Group at the Campbell Collaboration, and I am also the research methodologist for the [Scanlan Center for School Mental Health](https://scsmh.education.uiowa.edu/).

I am a Quantitative Researcher at the American Institutes for Research. I have a PhD in Quantitative Methods from The University of Texas at Austin. For my dissertation, I examined methods to handle dependent effects sizes in meta-analysis with a small number of studies. I have also consulted on applied meta-analyses in education and political science providing methodological and programming support to analyze data with complex structures. Moreover, I have experience organizing for graduate student rights at UT Austin.

I am a PhD candidate at Johns Hopkins University, School of Education. My primary research interests include students’ well-being, social media usage, and automated meta-analysis workflows. Before coming to Johns Hopkins, I graduated with a master’s degree in Education Policy from the Graduate School of Education, University of Pennsylvania. I also hold dual Bachelor’s degrees in Economics and Industrial Systems Engineering (with Honors and Distinction) from the National University of Singapore.
