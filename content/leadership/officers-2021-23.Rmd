I am a Quantitative Researcher at the American Institutes for Research. I have a PhD in Quantitative Methods from The University of Texas at Austin. For my dissertation, I examined methods to handle dependent effects sizes in meta-analysis with a small number of studies. I have also consulted on applied meta-analyses in education and political science providing methodological and programming support to analyze data with complex structures. Moreover, I have experience organizing for graduate student rights at UT Austin.
