#### _Methodological Approaches for Equity-Oriented Evidence Synthesis_

Time: 11:25 am - 12:55 pm (EDT)

Location: Philadelphia Marriott Downtown, Level 4, Franklin 8

Session Type: Symposium

Chair: Sarah Peko-Spicer

Discussant: Dorothy L. Espelage

Abstract: Conducting research that attends to racial inequities requires both a commitment to asking critical questions of our current education systems and a commitment to interrogate and change how we answer those questions. This symposium engages the audience in a discussion of how we might change our methodological approach to evidence synthesis in order to conduct transformative research that advances equity. Grounding in a collection of synthesis studies on social and emotional learning programs, the four presentations explore how open science, collaborative projects, the study of heterogeneity, and increased attention to measurement can help generate a more nuanced evidence synthesis that supports us in cultivating education futures in which students feel safe, supported, and able to thrive.
