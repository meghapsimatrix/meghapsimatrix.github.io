      <description>October 18, 2024, 9 am CDT Fitting Flexible Meta-Analytic Models with Structural Equation Modeling
  Speaker: Dr. Mike Cheung, National University of Singapore
  Description: Understanding the differences between various meta-analytic models, such as the fixed-effect, random-effects, and multiplicative error models, can be challenging for researchers. This presentation explains these models using a graphical representation within a structural equation modeling (SEM) framework. Users specify meta-analytic models using lavaan syntax.</description>

      <description>November 15, 2024, 11 am CST Using GPT API Models as Second Screeners of Titles and Abstracts in High-Quality Systematic Reviews
  Speaker: Dr. Mikkel Vembye, Danish Center for Social Science Research
  Description: Independent human double screening of titles and abstracts is a critical step to ensure the quality of systematic reviews and meta-analyses. However, double screening is a resource-demanding procedure that slows down the review process. In this presentation, I will demonstrate how reviewers reliably can implement OpenAI’s GPT models as second screeners of title and abstracts to mitigate this resource demand.</description>

      <description>May 17, 2024 Investigating Patterns of Fadeout using MERF, the Meta-Analysis of Educational RCTs with Follow-up
  Speaker: Emma Hart, Doctoral Candidate, Teachers College, Columbia University
  Description: Researchers and policymakers aspire for educational interventions to change children’s long-run developmental trajectories. Developmental theory has informed this expectation; boosts to child skills should initiate developmental cascades consistent with long-run intervention effects. Increasing evidence suggests that while interventions often generate impacts on child skills at post-test, these effects commonly fade in the years following the intervention’s end.</description>

      <description>May 19, 2023 MetaReviewer: A Free, Collaborative, Browser-Based Tool for Conducting Data Extraction
  Speaker: Joshua Polanin, American Institutes for Research
  Description: Collecting evidence synthesis data from even a few studies presents numerous logistical and organizational challenges. Reviewers with the expertise or resources turn to bespoke database software or costly meta-analysis programs. In the absence of resources or expertise, many reviewers turn to a spreadsheet, which can lead to inaccurate or unreliable data collection.</description>

      <title>What is Meta-Analysis?</title>
      <link>https://www.srmasig.org/posts/ma_methods/meta_analysis_intro/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 21 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.srmasig.org/posts/ma_methods/meta_analysis_intro/</guid>
      <description>Scientific researchers tend to produce literature on the same topiceither to replicate or extend prior studies or due to a lack ofawareness of prior evidence (Hedges &amp;amp; Cooper, 2009). Results acrossstudies tend to vary, even when researchers try to replicate studies,due to differences in sample characteristics, research designs, analyticstrategies or sampling error (Hedges &amp;amp; Cooper, 2009).
Meta-analysis is a set of statistical techniques for synthesizingresults from multiple primary studies on a common topic.</description>
