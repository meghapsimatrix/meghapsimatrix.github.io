      <description>May 17, 2024 Investigating Patterns of Fadeout using MERF, the Meta-Analysis of Educational RCTs with Follow-up
  Speaker: Emma Hart, Doctoral Candidate, Teachers College, Columbia University
  Description: Researchers and policymakers aspire for educational interventions to change children’s long-run developmental trajectories. Developmental theory has informed this expectation; boosts to child skills should initiate developmental cascades consistent with long-run intervention effects. Increasing evidence suggests that while interventions often generate impacts on child skills at post-test, these effects commonly fade in the years following the intervention’s end.</description>

      <description>May 19, 2023 MetaReviewer: A Free, Collaborative, Browser-Based Tool for Conducting Data Extraction
  Speaker: Joshua Polanin, American Institutes for Research
  Description: Collecting evidence synthesis data from even a few studies presents numerous logistical and organizational challenges. Reviewers with the expertise or resources turn to bespoke database software or costly meta-analysis programs. In the absence of resources or expertise, many reviewers turn to a spreadsheet, which can lead to inaccurate or unreliable data collection.</description>
