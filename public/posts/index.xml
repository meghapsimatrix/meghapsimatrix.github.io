      <title>What is Meta-Analysis?</title>
      <link>https://www.srmasig.org/posts/ma_methods/meta_analysis_intro/</link>

      <description>Scientific researchers tend to produce literature on the same topiceither to replicate or extend prior studies or due to a lack ofawareness of prior evidence (Hedges &amp;amp; Cooper, 2009). Results acrossstudies tend to vary, even when researchers try to replicate studies,due to differences in sample characteristics, research designs, analyticstrategies or sampling error (Hedges &amp;amp; Cooper, 2009).
Meta-analysis is a set of statistical techniques for synthesizingresults from multiple primary studies on a common topic.</description>
